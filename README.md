#KBOMBS MYFLIX - React Front-End

This is the front-end portion of a full stack application called 'myFlix' which comprises the use of an externally hosted NOSQL database, (via mongoDB), a custom API which interacts
with and serves the database, (hosted on Heroku) and a front-end portion, made with React and Javascript.  Users can 'sign up' and 'login' upon which they will be taken to a main movie view, 
where they can view selected movies in greater detail and also add them to their list of 'favorites'.  Navigating to their profile view, users can view and edit their user data
as well as delete their account and view their list of favorited movies, removing any if they choose to do so. Users may also search for movies based on movie genre, which will return
a list of each movie that matches the genre searched for. The app is a demonstration of the full stack process, back-end and front-end coming together into something that gives 
value to the users.
